```bash
$ brew install httpie # if just a command

```

## list outdated package

```bash

```bash
$ brew tap
homebrew/cask
homebrew/core

If you install any formula, brew will search by the order:

```
custom repo
homebrew/core
```

## pin

Preventing formula from being upgraded when issuing the brew upgrade formula command.
